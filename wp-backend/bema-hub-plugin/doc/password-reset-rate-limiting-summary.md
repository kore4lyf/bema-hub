# Password Reset Rate Limiting Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented
1. **Separate Rate Limiting for Password Reset Requests**:
   - Created a dedicated rate limiting system for password reset requests using user meta fields
   - Set default limit to 5 requests per 24 hours (separate from general OTP limit)
   - Added human-readable time formatting for rate limiting messages

2. **Configurable Admin Settings**:
   - Added a new "Daily Password Reset Limit" field in the OTP Settings admin page
   - Default value set to 5 requests per 24 hours
   - Users can adjust this limit between 1-50 requests per day

3. **New User Meta Fields**:
   - `bema_password_reset_request_count`: Tracks password reset request count
   - `bema_last_password_reset_request`: Timestamp of last password reset request

4. **Updated Methods**:
   - `can_request_password_reset()`: Checks if user can request password reset
   - `increment_password_reset_request_count()`: Updates password reset counters
   - Modified `reset_password_request()` to use new rate limiting system

## Key Features
- **Separate Limits**: Password reset requests now have their own limit (5/day) separate from general OTP requests (10/day)
- **Human-Readable Messages**: Time remaining is formatted as "X hours, Y minutes, Z seconds"
- **Configurable**: Admins can adjust the limit through the settings page
- **Security**: Prevents abuse of password reset functionality while maintaining usability
