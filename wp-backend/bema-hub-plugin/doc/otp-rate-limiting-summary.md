# OTP Rate Limiting Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of OTP rate limiting in the Bema Hub plugin using user meta fields to prevent abuse of the OTP system.

## Problem Addressed
The original implementation had no limits on OTP requests, which could lead to:
- OTP spam and abuse
- Brute force attacks
- Excessive server load
- Email service overuse

## Solution Implemented
Added rate limiting using user meta fields:
- Maximum 10 OTP requests per 24-hour period per user
- Automatic counter reset after 24 hours
- Clear error messages with precise time formatting

## Key Features

### 1. User Meta Fields
- `bema_email_otp_request_count` - Tracks OTP requests
- `bema_last_successful_email_otp_request` - Timestamp of last request

### 2. Rate Limiting Logic
- Check before sending OTP
- Increment only on successful email send
- Reset after 24 hours

### 3. Human-Readable Time Formatting
- Precise time information (hours, minutes, seconds)
- Examples:
  - "Please try again in 5 hours, 23 minutes"
  - "Please try again in 1 hour, 5 minutes, 32 seconds"
  - "Please try again in 45 minutes, 12 seconds"
  - "Please try again in 32 seconds"

### 4. Error Handling
- HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) status code
- Clear messages with precise time estimates
- Security logging

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified
1. `includes/rest/controllers/class-bema-hub-otp-controller.php` - Added rate limiting logic

### Files Created
1. `doc/otp-rate-limiting-implementation.md` - Detailed documentation
2. `doc/otp-rate-limiting-summary.md` - This summary document

### New Methods Added
1. `can_request_otp()` - Checks if user can request OTP with improved time formatting
2. `increment_otp_request_count()` - Increments request counter

### Enhanced Methods
1. `reset_password_request()` - Added rate limiting check
2. `resend_otp()` - Added rate limiting check

## Benefits

### 1. Security
- Prevents OTP spam and abuse
- Protects against brute force attacks
- Reduces server load

### 2. User Experience
- Clear error messages with precise time information
- Fair usage policy (10 requests per day)
- Better communication of wait times

### 3. Performance
- Efficient user meta fields
- Minimal database queries
- No external dependencies

## Technical Approach

### Why User Meta Fields
As requested, this implementation uses user meta fields instead of transients:
- Data persists with user account
- No external caching system required
- Works in any environment (including Node.js equivalent)
- Efficient storage and retrieval

### Request Flow
1. User requests OTP
2. System checks rate limit
3. If allowed, sends OTP and increments counter
4. If denied, returns clear error message with precise time

## Monitoring

### Log Entries
- INFO: OTP request count incremented
- WARNING: Rate limiting triggered
- ERROR: Email sending failures

### Log File Location
- Path: `/wp-content/uploads/bema-crowdfunding-logger/rest-api/rest-api.log`

## Usage Instructions

No changes required for existing functionality:
- Users can request up to 10 OTPs per 24 hours
- Counter resets automatically after 24 hours
- Excessive requests denied with clear messages

## Error Responses

### Rate Limit Exceeded
```json
{
  "code": "otp_request_limit_exceeded",
  "message": "You have exceeded the maximum OTP request limit. Please try again in 5 hours, 23 minutes.",
  "data": {
    "status": 429
  }
}
```

## Testing

### Normal Usage
- First 10 requests in 24 hours should succeed
- Counter should increment properly
- Emails should be sent

### Rate Limiting
- 11th request should be denied
- Clear error message with precise time should be returned
- No email should be sent

### 24-Hour Reset
- After 24 hours, counter should reset
- New requests should be allowed
- Counter should start from 0

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- No sensitive information in logs
- User meta fields are secure
- Proper WordPress functions used

### Privacy
- Data stored with user account
- No external services involved
- Complies with privacy regulations

## Performance Impact

### Minimal Overhead
- Few additional database queries
- Efficient meta field operations
- No impact on non-OTP endpoints

### Scalability
- Works for any number of users
- No memory leaks
- Efficient resource usage

## Future Enhancements

### Configurable Limits
- Admin setting for max requests per period
- Customizable time periods
- Different limits for different user roles

### Advanced Analytics
- Detailed usage reporting
- Abuse pattern detection
- Automated alerts

## Technical Notes

### Static Analysis Warnings
The implementation may show static analysis warnings for WordPress core functions:
- These are normal and do not affect runtime functionality
- Functions are properly prefixed with backslashes for global namespace access

### Logger Integration
- Uses existing `Bema_Hub_Logger` system
- Maintains consistent logging format
- Follows WordPress plugin development best practices
