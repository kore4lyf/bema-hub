# Complete Change Log

This document summarizes all the major changes, improvements, and iterations made during the development of the Bema Hub plugin.

## Initial Implementation Phase

### Core Authentication System
- Implemented REST API endpoints for signup, OTP verification, social login, traditional login, and signout
- Created comprehensive documentation for all endpoints
- Used WordPress database tables (wp_users, wp_usermeta) with custom fields prefixed with "bema_"
- Implemented JWT token authentication with 7-day expiration
- Created modular controller-based architecture

### Documentation
- Created detailed documentation for each endpoint
- Developed implementation summary document
- Created user meta fields reference

## Iteration 1: OTP Verification Improvements

### User Feedback
- User pointed out that OTP verification should use email instead of user_id since users remember their email
- User requested OTP expiration time be increased from 5 to 10 minutes

### Changes Made
- Modified the verify_otp method to accept email instead of user_id
- Updated OTP expiration time to 10 minutes (600 seconds)
- Updated all related documentation

## Iteration 2: Signout Endpoint Implementation

### User Request
- User requested implementation of a signout endpoint

### Implementation
- Added the POST /wp-json/bema-hub/v1/auth/signout endpoint to the REST API
- Implemented token invalidation by adding tokens to a blacklist stored in WordPress options
- Updated documentation to reflect the new endpoint

## Iteration 3: Logger Enhancement

### User Request
- User emphasized the importance of using the logger properly throughout the implementation

### Implementation
- Reviewed the existing logger implementation and ensured proper logging was in place
- Added logging to OTP verification in JWT auth class
- Enhanced logging for token invalidation during signout
- Added logging for token validation failures when invalidated tokens are detected
- Updated all documentation to reflect enhanced logging features

## Iteration 4: Password Reset Implementation

### User Request
- User requested password reset functionality with OTP verification

### Implementation
- Implemented a three-step password reset process:
  * Reset password request endpoint
  * OTP verification (reusing existing endpoint)
  * Password update endpoint
- Refined the implementation to use shared OTP fields with a purpose tracker
- Created separate endpoints for password reset verification and update

## Iteration 5: Architecture Refactoring

### User Request
- User requested that endpoints logic be separated into separate files

### Implementation
- Created a modular controller-based architecture:
  * Auth Controller: Handles authentication endpoints (login, signup, social login)
  * OTP Controller: Manages OTP-related functionality (verification, password reset)
  * User Controller: Manages user operations (profile, signout, token validation)
  * Main REST API Class: Registers routes and coordinates controllers
- Updated documentation to reflect the new architecture

## Iteration 6: City to State Update

### User Request
- User requested changing "city" references to "state" throughout the codebase and documentation

### Implementation
- Updated all PHP files and documentation to use "state" instead of "city"
- Modified variable names, user meta fields, and documentation references
- Created summary document for all changes

## Iteration 7: Redux Integration Update

### User Request
- User clarified they're using RTK Query with fetchBaseQuery, not createAsyncThunk
- User requested frontend integration examples using RTK Query with fetchBaseQuery

### Implementation
- Updated the frontend integration guide to show RTK Query implementation
- Created comprehensive RTK Query API service with fetchBaseQuery
- Implemented custom authentication hooks
- Updated component examples to use RTK Query patterns
- Created multiple documentation files specifically addressing RTK Query implementation:
  * [frontend-integration-guide.md](file:///c:/Users/akfal/Documents/bema-hub/wp-backend/bema-hub-plugin/doc/frontend-integration-guide.md) - Complete integration guide
  * [redux-rtk-query-implementation.md](file:///c:/Users/akfal/Documents/bema-hub/wp-backend/bema-hub-plugin/doc/redux-rtk-query-implementation.md) - Specific RTK Query implementation details
  * [rtk-query-frontend-patterns.md](file:///c:/Users/akfal/Documents/bema-hub/wp-backend/bema-hub-plugin/doc/rtk-query-frontend-patterns.md) - Detailed patterns for the specific implementation
  * [final-implementation-summary.md](file:///c:/Users/akfal/Documents/bema-hub/wp-backend/bema-hub-plugin/doc/final-implementation-summary.md) - Final implementation overview

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. WordPress Integration
- Used WordPress core functions with backslashes for global namespace
- Implemented proper error handling with WP_Error
- Leveraged existing WordPress database tables (wp_users, wp_usermeta)

### 2. Security Features
- Implemented JWT token authentication with proper expiration
- Added token invalidation through blacklisting
- Used SHA256 hashing for OTP codes
- Implemented encryption for sensitive data (phone numbers)
- Added comprehensive logging for security monitoring

### 3. OTP System Optimization
- Reused existing OTP meta fields with purpose tracking instead of creating separate fields
- Implemented single OTP field ([bema_otp_code](file:///c:/Users/akfal/Documents/bema-hub/wp-backend/bema-hub-plugin/doc/user-meta-fields.md#L210-L211)) with purpose tracker ([bema_otp_purpose](file:///c:/Users/akfal/Documents/bema-hub/wp-backend/bema-hub-plugin/doc/user-meta-fields.md#L212-L213))
- Extended OTP expiration to 10 minutes per user request

### 4. Architecture Improvements
- Created modular controller-based architecture for better maintainability
- Separated concerns with distinct controllers for auth, OTP, and user operations
- Implemented dependency injection through constructor injection

### 5. Frontend Integration
- Designed API endpoints specifically for Redux Toolkit RTK Query with fetchBaseQuery
- Created comprehensive documentation for frontend integration
- Implemented patterns that leverage RTK Query's automatic caching and state management
