# Bema Hub Plugin Implementation Summary

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Bema Hub plugin implementation, including the architecture, data structures, and key components.

## Architecture Overview

The Bema Hub plugin follows a modular, controller-based architecture that separates concerns and promotes maintainability:

### Main Components

1. **Main Plugin Class** (`class-bema-hub.php`)
   - Initializes the plugin and registers hooks
   - Loads dependencies and sets up the REST API

2. **REST API Controller** (`class-bema-hub-rest-api.php`)
   - Registers all REST API endpoints
   - Coordinates between controllers
   - Handles token persistence

3. **Controller Classes** (in `controllers/` directory)
   - **Auth Controller**: Handles authentication endpoints (login, signup, social login)
   - **OTP Controller**: Manages OTP-related functionality (verification, password reset)
   - **User Controller**: Manages user operations (profile, signout, token validation)

4. **JWT Authentication** (`class-bema-hub-jwt-auth.php`)
   - Generates and validates JWT tokens
   - Handles user authentication

5. **Logger** (`class-bema-logger.php`)
   - Provides comprehensive logging for security monitoring
   - Stores logs securely with automatic cleanup

### Data Flow

1. Plugin initialization loads all dependencies
2. REST API routes are registered during the `rest_api_init` hook
3. Incoming requests are routed to appropriate controllers
4. Controllers handle business logic and return responses
5. Security events are logged throughout the process

## User Data Structure

### WordPress User Table (wp_users)
- `ID` - Auto-incrementing user ID
- `user_login` - Generated from email (e.g., user@example.com becomes user_example_com)
- `user_pass` - Hashed password
- `user_email` - User's email address
- `user_registered` - Registration timestamp
- `display_name` - User's full name (first_name last_name)

### Custom User Meta Fields (wp_usermeta)

All custom fields use the `bema_` prefix to avoid conflicts:

| Field Name | Type | Description |
|------------|------|-------------|
| bema_first_name | String | User's first name |
| bema_last_name | String | User's last name |
| bema_phone_number | String (Encrypted) | User's phone number (encrypted) |
| bema_country | String | User's country |
| bema_state | String (Optional) | User's state |
| bema_referred_by | String (Optional) | Referral code or user ID |
| bema_tier_level | String | User's tier level (Opt-In, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum) |
| bema_account_type | String | Account type (subscriber, premium, admin) |
| bema_email_verified | Boolean | Email verification status |
| bema_phone_verified | Boolean | Phone verification status |
| bema_fraud_flag | Boolean | Fraud detection flag |
| bema_device_id | String | Unique device identifier |
| bema_last_signin | Timestamp | Last signin timestamp |
| bema_last_signout | Timestamp | Last signout timestamp |
| bema_otp_code | String (SHA256 Hash) | Hashed OTP code for all verification purposes |
| bema_otp_expiry | Timestamp | OTP expiration timestamp |
| bema_otp_purpose | String | Purpose of OTP (email_verification, password_reset) |
| bema_google_id | String (Optional) | Google user ID for social login |
| bema_facebook_id | String (Optional) | Facebook user ID for social login |
| bema_twitter_id | String (Optional) | Twitter user ID for social login |

## Authentication Flow

### 1. Email Signup
1. User submits email, password, and profile information
2. System validates input and checks for existing email
3. User account is created with default values
4. OTP is generated and sent for email verification
5. User verifies OTP to complete registration

### 2. Social Login
1. User authenticates with Google, Facebook, or Twitter
2. System checks for existing account with provider ID
3. If not found, checks for existing account with email
4. If neither exists, creates new account
5. Returns JWT token for authenticated access

### 3. Traditional Login
1. User provides username/email and password
2. System authenticates credentials
3. If valid, generates and returns JWT token

### 4. Token Management
1. JWT tokens are generated with 7-day expiration
2. Tokens contain user ID, login, and email
3. Tokens are validated on protected endpoints
4. Tokens can be invalidated through signout
5. Invalidated tokens are persisted across requests

### 5. Password Reset
1. User requests password reset with email
2. System generates OTP and sends to user
3. User verifies OTP to receive temporary reset token
4. User provides new password with reset token
5. System updates password and invalidates reset token

## Security Features

### JWT Token Security
- Tokens are signed with HMAC-SHA256 using a secret key
- Tokens expire after 7 days
- Tokens include issued at, not before, and expiration claims
- Token validation includes signature verification and expiration check

### OTP Security
- OTP codes are 6-digit random numbers
- OTP codes expire after 10 minutes
- OTP codes are SHA256 hashed before storage
- Single OTP field reused for all verification purposes with purpose tracking

### Data Protection
- Phone numbers are encrypted before storage
- OTP codes and tokens are never logged in full
- Input validation prevents injection attacks
- Rate limiting should be implemented at the server level

### Authentication Logging
- All authentication events are logged
- Failed attempts are logged with details
- Successful logins and signouts are logged
- OTP generation and verification are logged
- Token validation attempts are logged

## API Endpoints

### Authentication Endpoints
- `POST /wp-json/bema-hub/v1/auth/signup` - User registration
- `POST /wp-json/bema-hub/v1/auth/verify-otp` - OTP verification
- `POST /wp-json/bema-hub/v1/auth/signin` - User login
- `POST /wp-json/bema-hub/v1/auth/social-login` - Social authentication
- `POST /wp-json/bema-hub/v1/auth/signout` - User signout
- `POST /wp-json/bema-hub/v1/auth/validate` - Token validation
- `POST /wp-json/bema-hub/v1/auth/reset-password-request` - Password reset request

### Protected Endpoints
- `GET /wp-json/bema-hub/v1/profile` - User profile information

## Implementation Details

### Modular Controller Architecture
The system uses a modular controller-based approach:
- Each controller handles a specific domain of functionality
- Controllers receive dependencies through constructor injection
- Controllers are loosely coupled through the main REST API class
- Route registration is centralized in the main REST API class

### Token Invalidation
- Tokens are invalidated during signout by adding them to a blacklist
- The blacklist is persisted to the WordPress options table
- On shutdown, the invalidated tokens are saved to ensure persistence
- During token validation, the system checks against the invalidated tokens list

### Shared OTP Fields
Instead of creating separate OTP fields for each use case:
- Single OTP field (`bema_otp_code`) is used for all verification purposes
- Purpose is tracked with `bema_otp_purpose` field
- This prevents data duplication and simplifies management
- Users can only have one active OTP at a time

### Error Handling
- All endpoints return appropriate HTTP status codes
- Error responses follow WordPress REST API conventions
- Detailed error information is logged for debugging
- User-facing error messages do not expose sensitive information

### Performance Considerations
- Database queries are optimized with appropriate indexes
- Caching should be implemented for frequently accessed data
- Heavy operations are avoided in the request lifecycle
- Logging is performed efficiently to minimize performance impact

## Future Enhancements

### Scalability Improvements
- Implement database indexing for frequently queried fields
- Add caching layer for user metadata
- Consider distributed token storage for high-traffic scenarios

### Security Enhancements
- Implement rate limiting for authentication endpoints
- Add two-factor authentication support
- Enhance encryption for sensitive data
- Implement more sophisticated fraud detection

### Feature Extensions
- Add user profile picture upload
- Implement account linking for multiple social providers
- Add password strength requirements
- Implement account recovery options
